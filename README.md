# Branches
The `sass` branch is the main, up-to-date one (but I'm too scared to set it as default).

`master` was the one I used for a long time, but then I discovered CSS Flexbox and Grid and wanted to start using those for layout instead.

So I setup `flexgrid` for that purpose. But I soon discovered that my beloved SASS/Compass had been deprecated and I needed to find a new CSS pre-processor...

So I finally setup `sass` using the latest dart-sass, along with CSS Flexbox and Grid. And now this is what I use currently.

Eventually I'll remove the old branches and set `sass` as default, but I'll need to double-check all my sites first...
